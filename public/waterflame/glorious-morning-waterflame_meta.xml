  <description>&lt;div&gt;Author Comments:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Made in 2007!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This music has a long history of development. it started out as a small victory fanfare for a game called mecha pumble, but i liked the clip so much after finishing it that I decided to try to make something more of it. the original song is about twice in length,Â  but pulled out / just has more of the same. later when the contest for castlecrashers songs came up, I cleaned it up into a loop and submitted it, I figured it would go well for something of an intro. I placed 4th, if i recall correctly. later this music was used as the theme song in a few flash games, like for instance, age of war, siegius, etc. Now a final remake is in production, but until then, enjoy this, almost classic tune by now ;)&lt;/div&gt;</description>
