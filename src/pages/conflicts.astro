    England's Jamestown colony (1607–1699) was a tinderbox of conflict from the start. Settlers arrived hoping for gold but found disease, hunger, and hostile territory: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/smith-map-of-virginia.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Smith’s Map of Virginia</a>. They settled in the heart of Chief Powhatan's realm, along the James River, far from home and help. In fact, one of the first maps of the region was drawn by Captain John Smith in 1612, painstakingly marking <em>over 200</em> native towns around Chesapeake Bay. (That map – embedded below – shows the James River winding through native villages.)

    The first yeards were bad lol
    Jamestown's first years were brutal. By January 1608 only 38 of the original 104 colonists were alive. A combination of dysentery, malaria, a burned fort, and an especially harsh winter had taken a heavy toll. Relief seemed impossible until more ships arrived in 1608 with supplies and – later – more gunpowder. Even so, the colonists lived in a deer fence fort and quarreled about leadership. The Virginia Company in London demanded quick profits, not realizing their laborers were just trying to survive. In Jamestown, the idealism of gentlemen investors clashed with the reality of hungry settlers.

  <p>
    Legend has it that Pocahontas – Powhatan's daughter – dramatically saved Captain John Smith from ritual execution. According to Smith's own account, just as he was about to be clubbed to death, 11-year-old Pocahontas threw herself on him. Modern historians debate the true intent (some say it was a sacred ritual, not an attempted murder). Either way, after that tense encounter Smith and Chief Powhatan reached a shaky peace. Pocahontas (real name Mataoka) even learned English, was baptized “Rebecca,” and eventually married John Rolfe. (This Anglo-Indian marriage in 1614 helped end the First Anglo-Powhatan War.)

  <h2>The Starving Time (Winter 1609–1610)</h2>

  <p>
    Even peace with Powhatan didn't make life easy. In summer 1609, 600 new settlers arrived – the colony's population doubled. But fate was cruel: those ships ran aground in Bermuda, leaving Jamestown with <em>more mouths to feed and fewer supplies</em>. Chief Powhatan laid siege to the fort that winter, barring the English from hunting or raiding nearby farms. By late 1609 the settlers were desperate. Horses, dogs, cats, and rats were slaughtered for food, and the colonists even ate shoe leather. Archaeological and written evidence confirms that some resorted to cannibalism. As young George Percy, a colonist who survived to tell the tale, wrote later: <strong>“some ate their comrades and others <em>licked up the blood</em> which hath fallen from their weak fellows.”</strong>
  </p>

  <blockquote class="callout">
    “Some [colonists] ate their comrades and others ‘licked upp the Bloode which hath fallen from their weake fellowes.’”
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    By spring 1610 nearly the entire colony was gone – only about 60 of the 500+ original settlers remained alive. When Lord Delaware's relief fleet finally turned around (tipped off by burning tobacco), the survivors were ready to abandon Jamestown. It was <em>only</em> by the literal last minute that they turned their ships back, after the arrival of new colonists and provisions from Bermuda. The Virginia Company in London got the bad news: “Only sixty of the earlier 214 survived” – a financial catastrophe they could never have advertised in their investment prospectuses. Needless to say, many British investors wavered on their shares when they heard of Jamestown's starvation and chaos.
  </p>

  <h2>Anglo-Powhatan Wars</h2>

  <p>
    Relations with Chief Powhatan's confederacy took a permanent turn for the worse after the Starving Time. Early on, Governor Sir Thomas Gates and Thomas West, Lord De La Warr, decided on a strategy of conquest and holy conversion. The Company's instructions were blunt: if persuasion failed, it was “not cruelty nor a breach of charity to deal more sharply” with the Powhatans. In practice this led to brutal skirmishes and massacres. For example, in 1610 George Percy (now governor) led an attack that destroyed the Paspahegh village; according to a period chronicle, Percy later “put [a captured] queen to the sworde” and even threw captured children overboard, shooting them in the river. (This savagery horrified some Jamestowners – evidently Percy himself had “seene so mutch bloodshedd that day” that he spared the Paspahegh queen from being burned alive – but the damage was done.)
  </p>

  <blockquote class="callout">
    “In 1610, with 60 men, Percy's force 'put [a captured] Queen to the sworde' and 'put her children to death by throwing them overboard and shooting out their braines in the water.'”
  </blockquote>
  
 

  <p>
    Meanwhile, English colonists built forts up and down the river to defend themselves, and took native cornfields by force when needed. Hostilities quieted a bit during Rolfe and Pocahontas's marriage peace, but after Powhatan died in 1618 his brother <strong>Opechancanough</strong> became paramount chief and war party. In 1622 he organized a surprise assault on Good Friday: Powhatan warriors across the James Valley coordinated to attack plantations and villages. About 350 colonists – roughly a quarter of Virginia's English population – were slaughtered that day. Jamestown itself was largely spared, but the colony was shaken to its core.

  <blockquote class="callout">
    “On March 22, 1622, small bands of Opechancanough's warriors struck Jamestown's plantations … about 350 people were killed, a quarter of the English population.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The colonial response was merciless. They declared a war of extermination: English militias laid waste to Native towns wherever they found them. Over the next decade, the conflict ebbed and flowed. A Third Anglo-Powhatan War (1644–46) led by an aging Opechancanough nearly wiped out the English again before a peace treaty was signed. In each war, the balance tipped slightly in England's favor only as more settlers flooded Virginia and gained firepower. By 1646 Powhatan rule had collapsed – but the price was enormous suffering on both sides.
  </p>

  <h2>Spanish Spies and Other Threats</h2>

  <p>
    Jamestown was not just beset by Native wars. Spain, claiming all of the Americas, regarded an English foothold as a strategic threat. Until 1604 England and Spain were officially at peace, but wary spies lurked. In 1611 a Spanish galleon anchored near Point Comfort, and two men – captain Diego de Molina and an aide – came ashore only to be seized by the fort's garrison. Governor Thomas Dale suspected a scouting mission for a Spanish invasion. He later fretted, <em>“What may be the danger of this unto us who are here so few, so weake and unfortified?”</em> (England and Spain had only narrowly signed the Treaty of London in 1604.)
  </p>

  <blockquote class="callout">
    “Governor Thomas Dale worried: 'What may be the danger of this unto us who are here so few, so weake and unfortified?'”
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Fortunately for the colonists, no Spanish armada materialized at Jamestown. Still, the English kept one eye on the sea. Plans were even made to move the colony upriver (to “Henricus”) to frustrate any naval attack. Ultimately, the bigger threats remained hunger and hostile Indians. And of course the infighting back in London: the Virginia Company's charter was revoked in 1624 after the 1622 massacre shook royal confidence. Virginia became a crown colony, but the same dramas of power and prejudice would follow – through Bacon's Rebellion (1676) and beyond.
