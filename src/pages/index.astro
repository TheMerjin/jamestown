      <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
      <p>
        Why was Jamestown important?
        Jamestown was important because of the fact that it was the <span class="highlight">first permanent English settlement</span> in North America. To be concise, it set multifarious precedents in many varied aspects of American culture many of which are followed to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite inital struggles, the settler's will's were strong and they managed to persist despite the metaphorical onslaught: famine, disease, and war.

      <h2>Economic Innovation</h2>
      <p>
        Jamestown was principally established by bankers through joint-stock companies. <span class="highlight">  Tobacco as a cash crop</span>, was pioneered by Jamestwon along with the use of slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Headright system was introduced for the primary purpose of fostering growth and encouringing exploration of the America's as land is a very powerful so called "pull" factor, wherein pull represents incentives to the human that cause a shift in behavior, primarily in location.

      <h2>Political Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Jamestown established the <span class="highlight">House of Burgesses</span> in 1619,
        the first representative legislative assembly in the Americas. Additionally, Jamestown set an important precedent that of the ownership of human beings by human being not condoned but rather explicitly encouraged for economic purposes with moral justification. An example of a common moral justification typical of the time period is the following quote in leviticus "Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves"(Leviticus 25:44-46
New International Version).
